## Hi there 👋
# 💫 About Me:
Business Analyst by day, Excel ninja by night<br><br>💼 I turn coffee ☕ into insights 📊, dashboards 📈, and the occasional existential crisis over Excel formulas.<br><br>🧠 What I *think* I do<br>- Analyze data to find meaningful insights<br>- Solve business problems with SQL, Python, and too many tabs open<br>- Make dashboards so clean even Marie Kondo would be proud<br><br>😅 What I *actually* do<br>- Ask “Where is the data?”<br>- Fight with VLOOKUP until INDEX-MATCH saves the day<br>- Explain to stakeholders that *yes, correlation ≠ causation*<br>- Google: “How to write complex SQL query that actually works”<br><br>🛠️ Tools of the Trade<br>| Tool        | Use Case                     |<br>|-------------|------------------------------|<br>| **Excel**   | Where dreams (and models) are built |<br>| **SQL**     | Because we all love joining things |<br>| **Power BI**| Look ma, no code dashboards! |<br>| **Python**  | For those “this could’ve been done in Excel but I chose pain” moments |<br>| **Tableau** | For when you need *pretty* charts |<br><br>📈 Stats that may or may not impress you<br>- 47 tabs open right now<br>- 95% success rate at pretending to understand what the stakeholder wants<br>- 100% caffeine-powered<br><br>> *"Behind every successful analyst is a messy Excel file nobody talks about." – Probably me*
